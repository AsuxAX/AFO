# AFO
AFO (Automatic File Organizer) is a python script to automatically organize all files in a directory to its own folder and/or any new files in the directory.
Any change in the given directory will trigger the code and attempt to organize the folder again.

It creates a new folder for each different types of files, for example, for a text file it will create a folder named TEXT in the given directory if a folder named TEXT does not exist already.
It will use the existing folder and not create a new folder if it exists.

Instructions on setting it up: INSTRUCTIONS.txt
